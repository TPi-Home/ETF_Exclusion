# ETF_Exclusion
My intentions were to search through reddit user nobjos's excel sheet for individual stocks, thus ruling out market indexes, mutual funds and ETFs. I am going to compartmentalize this with different sheets for each exclusionary string.  I made this in 2021 and do not know if it works still. I would like to revisit it at some point.
